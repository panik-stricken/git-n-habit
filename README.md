## introduction
  GitHub is mainly a platform for software developers, and teams thereof, to collaborate on medium to enterprise scale programming projects.  
  
We are going to be using it for a much different purpose at first, and then get into the development aspect after a while.

If you REALLY have an intrest in learning more of this, you can... [here](https://guides.github.com/) But I suggest just using this as a messaging platform for the week. I will begin work on #2 _records_ When I return home.

## PREPARATION

Our first actual project on this, is in reference to issue #2, school records. 

I am going to _well, I have_ set this repository up on my local machine, and setup a branch to start working on this.
@Dragon-lover, we will cover branches and more in-depth issues in the future. Don't panic. :smile:
